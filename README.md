## Project Description: 

With the increase in attention on diabetes and its serious impact on one's health, my team is curious to find out what are the key indicators that is predictive of diabetes for our age group (i.e 18-24, young adult). As such we worked with a dataset regarding diabetes and its potential indicators found on kaggle.

The dataset we obtain from kaggle contains datas on individuals health status that has diabetes and no diabetes from all ages.

To kick start our investigation, we first cleaned the data to obtain datas from our targeted aged group and realise that only a small population is diagnosed with diabetes. We then went on to carry out Uni-Variate Exploration to better understand the individuals in our data.

From our Uni-Variate Exploration, we realise that only a small population of individuals have unhealthy eating habits, lifestyle and poor medical condition. We then proceed with our Bi-Variate Exploration but found no indicators that has a strong correlation with one's diabetic status.

This gives us some insight and direction to proceed with our investigation. We wonder if one being diagnosed with diabetes could be due to certain combination of indicator's state. Since only a small population in our dataset is diagnosed with diabetes. Our team plan to use multi-variate classifaction and anomaly detection. To deal with imbalance classes for classification, our team made used of smote.

Our rationale for using machine learning in this project is because we want to build a model that will allow us to correctly predict one’s diabetic status using only a few key important indicators. We compared the accuracy of the model build upon the few key indicators against the model build upon all indicators to obtain a result. If both models has similar accuracy and the accuracy is good, we can say that those few indicators are able to represent all the indicators.

As such, we manage to find our answers to our problem statement as we were able to obtain the top few key indicators that will allow us to predict one’s diabetic status
